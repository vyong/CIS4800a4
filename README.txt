**************
Complications
**************
Specular Lighting equation never worked out when trying to implement it into the program. When I applied it, it gave me a completely white circle.
Also, Shadows do not work as well as when trying to apply it, it didn't turn out correctly.

************
Compilation
************
To compile, make sure you are in the correct directory with all the folders and the makefile on the terminal. once confirmed, type 'make' in the terminal. This will compile the code and create three files in the same folder

***********************
Running the program(s)
***********************
to run the program, after compiling (see Compilation), type './a4 <filename>', and the program will execute. typing 'make run' will execute test program one. Typing 'make run2' will run the second example.
